## About Little Esty Shop

"Little Esty Shop" is a group project allows you to browse a collection of merchants, their items and their invoices. You can also access the site as if you were a merchant to view your personal items and invoices. 

## Workflow
We separated the user stories into two groups: admin and merchants. These two groups had two people assigned to them. Our main focus was to learn from this project, and we succeeded on that front in many ways. We completed all main features as described in the main user stories accompanied with a robust testing suite driven by TDD. Throughout the entire project, we kept clear and open communication through Slack and GitHub Projects. 

## Future Goals
There's always room to add more and the extension stories sound very exciting. Given more time, we'd love to explore these concepts. 
- Adding some sort of authorization or login, especially for the merchant where you can at least enter a Merchant ID and be taken to that merchant's dashboard.
- Advanced styling and fix those buttons! Who needs front end anyways. 
- Add customer functionality
